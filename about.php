		  <br>
		   This town was once established by Shrungmuni ancient times and so was known as Shrung gaon.
     The famous temple of Lord Shiva in this town also gave it recognition as Shivgaon. 
     Later Shivgaon became Shegaon. There might be a few legends about Shegaon but undoubtedly, 
     it has a unique importance and identity. Shegaon mainly known for the arrival of a bounteous, pious and the most noble holy figure, 
     i.e. Shri Gajanan Maharaj and his holy stay. One holy man landed in shegaon and with his omnipotent capacity changed the gloomy picture of this hamlet.
     He showered the blessings on the people who had barren life and gave them a taste of prosperity, spirituality and a path for meaningful life.
     Thus, this small village lying in the dark corners of Buldana district emerged as one of the happening places with spiritual touch in Maharastra.

		 (The information based on the original documents of Sansthan) <br>
<br>
In the holy presence of Shri Gajanan Maharaj the body of 12 trustees was unanimously formed on 12-09-1908 
with an objective to co-memorate this holy place where Shree hinted for Samadhi.<br>
<br>
Specially to note, this Sansthan came into existence in 1908 in the holy presence of Shree Maharaj. 
Because Shree Maharaj had foretold 'Ya Jagi Rahil Re' hinted at the specific place and day for his Samadhi.<br>
<br>
On 12-09-1909 a joint meeting was held as per the instructions of Maharaj in the grocery shop of Late Narayan Kadtaji Patil,
 where Shree's devotees, Shegaon's citizens and tradesmen had a brainstorming on the arrangements to be made in the Sansthan.
 Maharaj also present in this meeting. Thus Sansthan's first working committee was established <br>
<br>
A Blackstone from Wadegaon, Balapur (around 30 kms from Shegaon) area was brought. The masons from Nagpur,
 Late Kisan Mistri and Late Khandu Mistri innovatively created the Samadhi temple. On the holy occasion of the completion of 100 Years of Samadhi, 
the Shree temple was renovated with marble stones and was also made specious.<br><br>

<br><br>
 The most important feature of the Shree Gajanan Maharaj Sansthan is that is was formed in the presence of Shree Gajanan Maharaj in 
 the year 1908 by His divine grace.His yogic prowess enabled him to specify the date and place of his samadhi
 well in advance. His words 'Ya jaagi raaheel meaning 'Will stay here' were prophetic.Through the initiative of 
 his closest disciples, a conference comprising of Shree's devotees and the villagers and businesspersons of 
 Shegaon was organized at late Shri Narayan Kadtaji Patil's store on 12thSeptember 1908 (Ashwin shukla 1, Sanvat
 1885),under the guidance of Shree Gajanan Maharaj according to his instructions. The Sansthan came into existence
 in His divine presence.
